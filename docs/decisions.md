# Implementation decisions

Each entry records a reading of FORMAT.md chosen by the implementation. Each
entry is named by the FORMAT.md heading it reads.

## 11.1 INDEX

`container_len`, `body_crc32c` and `header_crc32c` are all derivable from
bytes the same call already lays out: `Index.Encode` computes and writes all
three, overwriting any value the caller set. `Index.Decode` verifies both
CRCs and refuses a mismatch. This does not change the bytes a correct writer
puts on disc; it only fixes which Go call computes them.

## 11.2 REFS and 11.3 DISCS

`RefsTable.Encode` and `DiscsTable.Encode` compute and write `body_crc32c`
and `header_crc32c` the same way, for the same reason. `Decode` for both
verifies both CRCs and refuses a mismatch.

## 10.3 Checksum column

`ChecksumRecord.Encode` computes and writes `header_crc32c` over bytes 0 to
15. `Decode` verifies it and refuses a mismatch.

## 6.1 Object kinds and the object header

`internal/object`'s writer compresses a chunk's payload, but always writes a
blob, a tree and a snapshot with `compression` 0. `Blob.Encode`,
`Tree.Encode` and `Snapshot.Encode` serialize typed fields straight into
their fixed offsets; they hold no opaque payload byte slot a generic
compressor could replace, unlike `Chunk.Payload`. Storing these three kinds
raw is always a valid outcome of the minimum-gain rule, so this does not
change what a reader accepts. Compressing them is future work, not a
disallowed one.

## 6.14 Snapshot

`internal/object`'s `Writer.Commit` takes one source directory and no parent
snapshot, so every commit it writes is a root snapshot: `generation` 1,
`parent` all zero, `parent_hash_algo` 0. Snapshot metadata TLVs (author,
host, message, exclude rules) are omitted, `meta_count` 0, because no
config or CLI layer exists yet to supply them at this layer. Parent
chaining and metadata belong to a later layer that already holds a
repository's snapshot history.

`source_flags` always carries `NO_SPARSE`: the writer never probes
`SEEK_HOLE`, so it never claims sparse detection happened.

## 10.5 Decode rule

`internal/fec`'s `Codec.Decode` takes an explicit set of surviving shards
and applies the base algebraic rule: it picks the `k` shards with the
lowest index and inverts `[I_k ; C]` restricted to those rows, per the
normative choice this heading states. It does not run the single-parity
retry loop itself, because that loop needs the checksum column and the
content ids INDEX maps into the stripe, and `internal/fec` takes byte
slices only, with no knowledge of INDEX or the checksum column's file
layout. The caller (the image package) is expected to try each erasure set
the retry loop names and call `Decode` again for each attempt. This does
not change which parity bytes a conforming writer produces or which stripe
a conforming reader accepts as decoded; it only fixes which package runs
the retry loop.

## 6.6 Tree entry fixed header and 6.7 Entry flags

`internal/object`'s writer always sets `CTIME_ABSENT` clear and
`ATIME_ABSENT` and `BTIME_ABSENT` set. This matches the Phase 1 defaults of
`metadata.ctime` true and `metadata.atime` and `metadata.btime` false; no
config layer exists yet at this layer to override them.
