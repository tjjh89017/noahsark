# Implementation decisions

Each entry records a reading of FORMAT.md chosen by the implementation. Each
entry is named by the FORMAT.md heading it reads.

## 11.1 INDEX

`container_len`, `body_crc32c` and `header_crc32c` are all derivable from
bytes the same call already lays out: `Index.Encode` computes and writes all
three, overwriting any value the caller set. `Index.Decode` verifies both
CRCs and refuses a mismatch. This does not change the bytes a correct writer
puts on disc; it only fixes which Go call computes them.

## 11.2 REFS and 11.3 DISCS

`RefsTable.Encode` and `DiscsTable.Encode` compute and write `body_crc32c`
and `header_crc32c` the same way, for the same reason. `Decode` for both
verifies both CRCs and refuses a mismatch.

## 10.3 Checksum column

`ChecksumRecord.Encode` computes and writes `header_crc32c` over bytes 0 to
15. `Decode` verifies it and refuses a mismatch.

## 6.1 Object kinds and the object header

`internal/object`'s writer compresses a chunk's payload, but always writes a
blob, a tree and a snapshot with `compression` 0. `Blob.Encode`,
`Tree.Encode` and `Snapshot.Encode` serialize typed fields straight into
their fixed offsets; they hold no opaque payload byte slot a generic
compressor could replace, unlike `Chunk.Payload`. Storing these three kinds
raw is always a valid outcome of the minimum-gain rule, so this does not
change what a reader accepts. Compressing them is future work, not a
disallowed one.

## 6.14 Snapshot

`internal/object`'s `Writer.Commit` takes one source directory and no parent
snapshot, so every commit it writes is a root snapshot: `generation` 1,
`parent` all zero, `parent_hash_algo` 0. Snapshot metadata TLVs (author,
host, message, exclude rules) are omitted, `meta_count` 0, because no
config or CLI layer exists yet to supply them at this layer. Parent
chaining and metadata belong to a later layer that already holds a
repository's snapshot history.

`source_flags` always carries `NO_SPARSE`: the writer never probes
`SEEK_HOLE`, so it never claims sparse detection happened.

## 10.5 Decode rule

`internal/fec`'s `Codec.Decode` takes an explicit set of surviving shards
and applies the base algebraic rule: it picks the `k` shards with the
lowest index and inverts `[I_k ; C]` restricted to those rows, per the
normative choice this heading states. It does not run the single-parity
retry loop itself, because that loop needs the checksum column and the
content ids INDEX maps into the stripe, and `internal/fec` takes byte
slices only, with no knowledge of INDEX or the checksum column's file
layout. The caller (the image package) is expected to try each erasure set
the retry loop names and call `Decode` again for each attempt. This does
not change which parity bytes a conforming writer produces or which stripe
a conforming reader accepts as decoded; it only fixes which package runs
the retry loop.

## 6.6 Tree entry fixed header and 6.7 Entry flags

`internal/object`'s writer always sets `CTIME_ABSENT` clear and
`ATIME_ABSENT` and `BTIME_ABSENT` set. This matches the Phase 1 defaults of
`metadata.ctime` true and `metadata.atime` and `metadata.btime` false; no
config layer exists yet at this layer to override them.

## 11.1 INDEX, Files table order and self-reference

Section 11.1 states Files table rows follow "FEC stream order", then lists
`checksum.bin`, every parity file and `RUN2.bin` as the explicit exceptions
that sit outside that order, appended after every stream row. Read
literally, that leaves `RUN.bin` (role 2) inside the row order the fixed
files follow, even though section 7.3 excludes `RUN.bin`'s own bytes from
the FEC stream. `internal/image` reads this as two different things
sharing one ordering rule: the Files table row order (used to place rows,
and read here as the row-placement order: INDEX, RUN, the first-run-only
fixed files, the catalog files, then every object row) and the FEC stream
(the bytes actually concatenated for parity, which is the same row order
with roles 2, 10, 11 and 12 skipped, exactly as section 11.1 states for
10, 11 and 12, extended here to 2 for the same reason section 7.3 gives).
This does not change any object's, `DISC.bin`'s, `REFS.bin`'s or
`DISCS.bin`'s bytes; it fixes only which row a reader expects at which
position, and the row order is stated in code and verified by round-trip
tests.

Row order also has a self-reference the section text does not resolve:
`INDEX.bin`'s own Files row needs `file_hash`, the hash of INDEX.bin's
whole bytes, but INDEX.bin's bytes are not final until every row,
including this one, is written. The same is true of `RUN.bin`'s row,
because `RUN.bin`'s content (`index_bytes`, `index_hash`) is only known
once INDEX.bin is final, and `RUN.bin` is written after INDEX per the fill
order in section 8.7. `internal/image` takes the simplest deterministic
reading: the Files rows for `INDEX.bin`, `RUN.bin`, `RUN2.bin`,
`checksum.bin` and every parity file carry `file_hash` all zero. Every
other row (`DISC.bin`, `REFERENCE/decoder.py`, `catalog/REFS.bin`,
`catalog/DISCS.bin`, every `catalog/snapobj` copy, and every object file)
carries the real sha256 of its whole encoded bytes, because those files
are fully known before INDEX is built. `RUN.bin`'s own `header_crc32c`
still lets a reader verify it directly; the Files table's `file_hash` for
that row is redundant with that check, not a reader's only way to verify
`RUN.bin`.

Row order for `catalog/snapobj` copies (role 9) and for object files (role
13) is not stated beyond "by file_hash ascending" for role 13.
`internal/image` sorts both groups by the sha256 of each file's own whole
bytes, ascending, and keeps that as the deterministic tie-break for role
9 too (ordered by the snapshot's own content id ascending, since a
snapshot's role-9 copy and its role-13 copy are byte-identical and a
content id is stable where a whole-file hash of role 9's copy is not
otherwise pinned by any other row).

## 8.2 Files at the volume root: README.txt and FORMAT.txt

`internal/image`'s `Build` does not generate `/NOAHSARK/README.txt` or
`/NOAHSARK/FORMAT.txt`. Their content is fixed, large, normative text
(section 8.4 and 8.5) outside this change's scope; the task that added
`internal/image` named the files it should produce and did not include
these two. A disc `internal/image` writes today is not yet complete
against section 8.2's file list; producing `README.txt` and `FORMAT.txt`
is left for later work.

## 8.1 Profiles a reader must know: filesystem overhead estimate

FORMAT.md gives the `mkudffs` options and the anchor placement rule but no
numeric UDF overhead budget. `internal/image`'s `CheckCapacity` takes the
simplest deterministic reading available from the project's own
measurements: the `probe-udf-small-files` action found small-file overhead
close to one logical block per file. `EstimateFilesystemOverhead` charges
one 2048-byte sector per file plus a fixed 1 MiB base cost for the volume
and partition descriptors, the anchors and the space bitmap. This is an
estimate used only to refuse an over-target pack before spending time
building it; it does not change any on-disc byte.

## 10.1 Profile 0 image build: how the volume is populated

`mkudffs` only makes an empty UDF filesystem; populating it needs a loop
mount, which needs root. `internal/image`'s `MakeImage` runs `mkudffs`
itself (needs no root), then, only when the `NOAHSARK_CI` environment
variable is set, shells out to `populate.sh` through `sudo` to loop-mount
the image, copy the `NOAHSARK` tree in, and unmount. Outside CI,
`MakeImage` builds the empty image and returns, so a build on a developer
machine with no root still exercises the `mkudffs` step and never blocks.
This follows option (c) from the task's own list turned into (a): a
from-scratch Go UDF writer was not attempted, since `udftools`'s own
`mkudffs` plus a root-only mount-and-copy step, run in CI where `sudo` is
available, is the simplest path that reaches conforming UDF bytes with no
new binary format code to maintain.
