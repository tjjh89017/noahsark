# Implementation decisions

Each entry records a reading of FORMAT.md chosen by the implementation. Each
entry is named by the FORMAT.md heading it reads.

## 11.1 INDEX

`container_len`, `body_crc32c` and `header_crc32c` are all derivable from
bytes the same call already lays out: `Index.Encode` computes and writes all
three, overwriting any value the caller set. `Index.Decode` verifies both
CRCs and refuses a mismatch. This does not change the bytes a correct writer
puts on disc; it only fixes which Go call computes them.

## 11.2 REFS and 11.3 DISCS

`RefsTable.Encode` and `DiscsTable.Encode` compute and write `body_crc32c`
and `header_crc32c` the same way, for the same reason. `Decode` for both
verifies both CRCs and refuses a mismatch.

## 10.3 Checksum column

`ChecksumRecord.Encode` computes and writes `header_crc32c` over bytes 0 to
15. `Decode` verifies it and refuses a mismatch.

## 6.1 Object kinds and the object header

`internal/object`'s writer compresses a chunk's payload, but always writes a
blob, a tree and a snapshot with `compression` 0. `Blob.Encode`,
`Tree.Encode` and `Snapshot.Encode` serialize typed fields straight into
their fixed offsets; they hold no opaque payload byte slot a generic
compressor could replace, unlike `Chunk.Payload`. Storing these three kinds
raw is always a valid outcome of the minimum-gain rule, so this does not
change what a reader accepts. Compressing them is future work, not a
disallowed one.

## 6.14 Snapshot

`internal/object`'s `Writer.Commit` takes one source directory and no parent
snapshot, so every commit it writes is a root snapshot: `generation` 1,
`parent` all zero, `parent_hash_algo` 0. Snapshot metadata TLVs (author,
host, message, exclude rules) are omitted, `meta_count` 0, because no
config or CLI layer exists yet to supply them at this layer. Parent
chaining and metadata belong to a later layer that already holds a
repository's snapshot history.

`source_flags` always carries `NO_SPARSE`: the writer never probes
`SEEK_HOLE`, so it never claims sparse detection happened.

## 6.6 Tree entry fixed header and 6.7 Entry flags

`internal/object`'s writer always sets `CTIME_ABSENT` clear and
`ATIME_ABSENT` and `BTIME_ABSENT` set. This matches the Phase 1 defaults of
`metadata.ctime` true and `metadata.atime` and `metadata.btime` false; no
config layer exists yet at this layer to override them.
